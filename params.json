  "body": "Calendaring Code Fest\r\n\r\n# What?\r\n\r\n2 days of intense work on calendaring software, with the focus on open standards.\r\n\r\n# Why?\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of open standards in the world of calendaring, but many existing calendaring products support only a fraction of what they could. This may be due to several reasons: being not aware of newer standards and a lack of time are probably some of the main reasons. Problems in understanding the standards or simply not seeing the advantages might be others. Not to forget the chicken-egg problem (Why should I support it if no one else does yet?).\r\nThe calendaring code fest aims to provide an opportunity for developers to work on the implementation of calendaring standards without distraction. You get to work in the same room with other developers on this field of expertise. All participants are encouraged to ask questions, learn from others and share their wisdom.\r\n\r\n# When?\r\n\r\nSeptember 10-11 2016\r\n9:00 - 18:00 \r\n\r\n# Where?\r\n\r\nSchandauer Straße 34, conference room 2nd floor\r\n01309 Dresden\r\nGermany\r\n\r\n# Who?\r\n\r\nEveryone who works or is interested to work on calendaring software products. There are no restrictions on the kind of software, except that is should be somehow related to calendaring and use open calendaring standards. Any language, any platform, open source, commercial, small projects, large projects, libraries, full featured applications, new projects, mature projects … you name it.\r\n\r\n# Accomodation\r\n\r\nWe don't recommend any specific hotels. Below you can find two hotels which still have free rooms around the Calendaring Code Fest weekend. In addition you might want to check out Airbnb as well.\r\n\r\nHotel am Blauen Wunder\r\nLoschwitzer Straße 48\r\n01309 Dresden\r\n\r\nAparthotel Villa Freisleben\r\nLoschwitzer Straße 19\r\n01309 Dresden\r\n\r\nIf you have trouble finding a place to stay, please contact us.\r\n\r\n# Costs\r\n\r\nThere are no registration fees for the event. [dmfs GmbH](http://dmfs.org) is going to sponsor a room and an Internet connection for the event itself as well as some beverages. Accommodation and food is on you. [SchedJoules](http://schedjoules.com) is going to sponsor some pizza for lunch.\r\n\r\n# Topics\r\n\r\nThe idea is that all participants come with a topic they want to work on in mind. Though if you don't have a topic yet, that's not an issue. We certainly can find one.\r\n\r\n# Agenda\r\n\r\n2016-09-10\r\n 8:30 Welcome & Introductions\r\n 9:00 Coding\r\n12:00 Lunch\r\n13:00 Coding\r\n17:30 Wrap-up\r\n\r\n2016-09-11\r\n 8:30 Coding\r\n12:00 Lunch\r\n13:00 Coding\r\n16:30 Presentation of results\r\n17:30 Close of Calendaring Code Fest\r\n\r\n# Legal stuff\r\n\r\nBy participating in the Calendaring Code Fest you agree to respect the license of the software products of all other participants.
