<h1>
<a id="what" class="anchor" href="#what" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What?</h1>

<p>2 days of intense work on calendaring software, with the focus on open standards.</p>

<h1>
<a id="why" class="anchor" href="#why" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why?</h1>

<p>There are plenty of open standards in the world of calendaring, but many existing calendaring products support only a fraction of what they could. This may be due to several reasons: being not aware of newer standards and a lack of time are probably some of the main reasons. Problems in understanding the standards or simply not seeing the advantages might be others. Not to forget the chicken-egg problem (Why should I support it if no one else does yet?).
The calendaring code fest aims to provide an opportunity for developers to work on the implementation of calendaring standards without distraction. You get to work in the same room with other developers on this field of expertise. All participants are encouraged to ask questions, learn from others and share their wisdom.</p>
